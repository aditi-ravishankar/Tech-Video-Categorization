# Tech-Video-Categorization

A tool to aid tech-video categorization into four classes, namely - 'Reviews', 'Comparisons', 'Unboxing' and 'Others'. 
Transcripts from the videos were first extracted using youtube-dl, then cleaned and labelled so as to create a dataset. 
The dataset was preprocessed using NLP techniques to increase the accuracy of the model. 
Three machine learning algorithms were then used for the classification process - Naive Bayes, Random forest and Support Vector Machine. 
The maximum accuracy obtained out of the three was 96%(SVM).
